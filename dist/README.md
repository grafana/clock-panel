## Clock Panel Plugin for Grafana

The Clock Panel can show the current time or a countdown and updates every second.

Show the time in another office or show a countdown to an important event.

### Options

- **Mode**:

  Default is time. If countdown is chosen then set the Countdown Deadline to start the countdown.

- **12 or 24 hour**:

  Show time in the 12/24 hour format.

- **Timezone**:

  This uses the moment-timezone module to provide suppoer for various zones and their offsets. Default is to guess what your local timezone is (whatever that is on your computer). -5 would be UTC -5 (New York or central US)

- **Countdown Deadline**:

  Used in conjuction with the mode being set to countdown. Choose a date and time to count down to.

- **Countdown End Text**:

  The text to show when the countdown ends. E.g. LIFTOFF

- **Date/Time formatting options**:

  The font size, weight and date/time formatting can be customized here. If the seconds ticking annoys you then change the time format to HH:mm for the 24 hour clock or h:mm A for the 12 hour clock.

- **Bg Color**:

  Choose a background color for the clock with the color picker.
